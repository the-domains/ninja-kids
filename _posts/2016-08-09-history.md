## **History**

Ninja Kids was conceived while Paul Teleki was working toward his NCCP1 and NCCP2 (National Coaching Certification) and grading for his blackbelt in Judo. The experience of assisting Sensei Hino's junior and senior Judo classes spurred the idea of reaching a younger group in order to prepare them for Judo classes in the future. The term "physical literacy" came out of the NCCP curriculum. Most importantly, the birth of my son Orion in Dec. 2013 inspired my desire to enable other children with the same skills around safety, confidence and respect for others.

## **Philosophy**

Ninja Kids guiding principles are: safety, confidence, and respect. It is an open-hand physical activity (never making fists) which focuses on helping children _protect_ their body when falling, _improve_ their physical abilities, and _help_ others stay safe. Most of Teleki's training is in Judo, which is translated to the Gentle-Way (Ju=Gentle, do=Way). Ukemi (breakfall) is the first thing you learn in Judo, and it also carries with it principles of respect, mutual welfare, balance, and intentionality. These experiences have led to the founding principles of Ninja Kids.

## **Curriculum**

Ninja Kids is rewards-based where kids will be given a variety of activities to accomplish. The rewards will include stickers which kids can take home and place on their Ninja Kids poster. Once a child completes their sticker collection, they can proceed to the next level in Ninja Kids which will eventually lead to their graduation and ceremony. Kids will learn to speak Japanese during class. Sensei Teleki can speak French, Hungarian, Japanese and English.

Each class begins with warm-up and stretching while proceeding into physical activities that promote safety, building confidence and respect for others. Throughout the class, there will be spontaneous games, challenges, and stretching activities. Integrated in each activity will include respect for others.

## **Acknowledgment:**

I could not run this class without some key people. I would like to thank Sensei Tomoyoshi Hino for allowing the Ninja Kids to borrow his amazing mats, first aid kit, and picture of Kano Sensei. With his teachings and inspiration, the Ninja Kids program was conceived. I would like to thank my beautiful wife for her support sharpening my delivery of Ninja Kids. I would like to thank the team at the Athletics Centre at Trent for working with me while setting up the mats. And thanks to the parents and children who have the patience to learn the fundamentals of safety, confidence, and respect.
